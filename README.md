## ðŸš¨ Before you clone (please read!!!)

A few people have contacted me asking if they can use my code for learning or for their own website, and the answer is **yes, absolutely, but please credit me as well as [Oluwadare Oluwaseyi](https://seyi.dev)**.

I wanted to share this project with all of y'all and that's why I pushed the code up here. However, keep in mind that, _**plagiarism is bad**_. So please give credits for the creators, as I did so with many websites from where I drew my inspirations. I spent quite a lot of time and effort building and designing this project, the least you can do is to give me credit, as well as [Oluwadare Oluwaseyi](https://seyi.dev).

### TL;DR

Yes, feel free to fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to [Ibrahim Raimi](https://ibrahimraimi.vercel.app) and [Oluwadare Oluwaseyi](https://seyi.dev). Thanks!
